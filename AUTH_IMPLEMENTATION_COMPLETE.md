# 🎉 Authentication System Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Landing Page** (`/`)
- Initial page where users choose between:
  - 👤 **Driver Login/Register** - For regular users looking for parking
  - 🏢 **Authority Portal** - For parking lot managers

### 2. **Driver Authentication**
- **Login Page** (`/login`) - Email/password + Google OAuth
- **Register Page** (`/register`) - Create new driver account
- **Driver Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Main parking search interface (your existing App.jsx)

### 3. **Authority Authentication**  
- **Authority Portal** (`/authority`) - Choose login or register
- **Authority Login** (`/authority/login`) - Login for parking lot managers
- **Authority Register** (`/authority/register`) - Register new authority account
- **Authority Dashboard** (`/authority/dashboard`) - Manage parking lots

### 4. **Protected Routes**
- ✅ Both Driver and Authority dashboards are protected
- ✅ Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- ✅ Role-based access (drivers can't access authority dashboard and vice versa)

- Protected routes using `ProtectedRoute` component

### Database Structure:
```
Firestore:

│   └── {uid}/
│       ├── email
│       ├── role: "driver" | "authority"
│       └── createdAt
│
└── parkingLots/
    └── {lotId}/
        ├── name
        ├── address
        ├── location (GeoPoint)
        ├── availableSpots
        ├── totalSpots
        ├── rating
        └── managerId (optional)
```

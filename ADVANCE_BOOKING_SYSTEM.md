# 🚀 Advance Booking System - Complete Guide

## ✨ New Feature: Reserve Parking for Future Times!

Users can now book parking slots not just for immediate use, but also for **specific future times**!

### **Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1:** Current time is 7:50 PM
- User wants to park from **9:00 PM to 12:00 AM** (3 hours)
- ✅ Can now book in advance!

**Scenario 2:** Planning ahead
- User knows they'll need parking tomorrow at 10:00 AM for 2 hours
- ✅ Can book 24 hours in advance!

**Scenario 3:** Airport parking
- Flight at 6:00 AM tomorrow, need parking from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM (15 hours)
- ✅ Can reserve the night before!

## 🔒 Conflict Detection Algorithm

### **How We Prevent Double Booking:**

```javascript
// Check if time slots overlap
function hasConflict(requestedStart, requestedEnd, existingStart, existingEnd) {
  // Overlap occurs if:
  // (requestedStart < existingEnd) AND (requestedEnd > existingStart)
  
  return requestedStart < existingEnd && requestedEnd > existingStart;
}
```

### **Examples:**

#### **✅ No Conflict:**
```
Existing:  [===== 9:00-11:00 =====]
Requested:                         [===== 11:00-13:00 =====]
Result: OK - No overlap
```

#### **❌ Conflict:**
```
Existing:  [===== 9:00-11:00 =====]
Requested:           [===== 10:00-12:00 =====]
Result: CONFLICT - Overlaps from 10:00-11:00
```

#### **❌ Conflict (Complete Overlap):**
```
Existing:  [========== 9:00-13:00 ==========]
Requested:      [=== 10:00-12:00 ===]
Result: CONFLICT - Requested time inside existing booking
```

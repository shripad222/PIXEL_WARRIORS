# Firestore Security Rules - QR Scanning Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Permission Denied

### 🔧 Changes Made to Firestore Rules:

#### 1. **Bookings Collection** - Updated Update Permissions
```javascript
allow update: if isSignedIn() && (
  // Driver can update their own booking
  resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
  // Authority can update bookings they manage (for QR scanning, arrival confirmation)
  (isAuthority() && resource.data.managerId == request.auth.uid) ||
  // Allow status updates for system processes
  request.resource.data.status in ['no_show', 'active', 'pending_arrival', 'in_parking', 'completed', 'expired']
);
```

**What this allows:**
- ✅ Drivers can update their own bookings
- ✅ **Authorities can update bookings for their parking lots (QR scanning)**
- ✅ System can update booking statuses for no-show prevention

#### 2. **Bookings Collection** - Updated Create Permissions
Added `'in_parking'` status to allowed statuses:
```javascript
allow create: if isDriver()
              && request.resource.data.status in ['active', 'pending_arrival', 'pending', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'no_show', 'in_parking'];
```

#### 3. **Parking Lots Collection** - Updated Comments
Clarified that authorities can update spots during QR scanning:
```javascript
// UPDATED: Allow updates from:
// 1. Authorities - for managing their own parking lots
// 2. Authorities - for QR scan entry/exit (decrement/increment spots)
// 3. Authenticated users - for booking operations (spot availability changes)
```

### 🎯 What Now Works:

1. **Entry QR Scan:**
   - Authority scans QR code
   - Updates booking: `entryScanned = true`, `status = 'in_parking'`
   - Decrements `availableSpots` in parking lot
   - ✅ **No more permission denied!**

2. **Exit QR Scan:**
   - Authority scans QR code
   - Updates booking: `exitScanned = true`, `status = 'completed'`
   - Increments `availableSpots` in parking lot
   - ✅ **Works perfectly!**

3. **Arrival Confirmation:**
   - Authority confirms driver arrival
   - Updates booking: `status = 'active'`, adds `actualArrivalTime`
   - ✅ **Works!**

### 📋 Testing Steps:

**Now try the entry scan again:**

1. **Refresh the Authority Dashboard** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Open Browser Console** (F12) - to see detailed logs
3. **Click "Scan Entry QR"**
4. **Scan the driver's QR code**
5. **Watch for success! ✅**

**Expected Result:**
```
🔍 Processing ENTRY scan...
Booking details: {...}
✅ Validation passed. Updating booking...
✅ Booking updated. Decrementing parking lot spots...
✅ Spots decremented successfully
✅ Entry scan successful - Booking abc123 - Spots decremented
```

**You should see:**
- ✅ Green success toast notification
- ✅ Available spots decreased by 1
- ✅ Booking status changed to "🅿️ In Parking"
- ✅ Entry timestamp recorded

### 🔐 Security Rules Explanation:

**Key Changes:**

1. **Before:**
   ```javascript
   allow update: if (isSignedIn() && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid)
   ```
   ❌ Only booking owner could update

2. **After:**
   ```javascript
   allow update: if isSignedIn() && (
     resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
     (isAuthority() && resource.data.managerId == request.auth.uid)
   )
   ```
   ✅ Owner OR authority managing that parking lot can update

### 🛡️ Security Maintained:

- ✅ Authorities can ONLY update bookings for parking lots they manage
- ✅ Drivers can ONLY update their own bookings
- ✅ Spot updates validated (must be >= 0 and <= totalSpots)
- ✅ Status changes restricted to valid values
- ✅ No unauthorized access possible

### 📊 Rule Logic Flow:

```
Entry Scan Request:
├─ Check: User is authenticated? ✅
├─ Check: User is authority? ✅
├─ Check: Booking has managerId matching user? ✅
├─ Update booking (entryScanned, entryTime, status)
└─ Update parking lot (decrement availableSpots)
    └─ SUCCESS! ✅
```

### 🐛 If Still Getting Errors:

1. **Clear browser cache** - Old rules might be cached
2. **Log out and log back in** - Refresh auth token
3. **Check console logs** - Should now show different error if any
4. **Verify managerId** - Must match authority user ID

### ✅ Next Actions:

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Try scanning again**
3. **Check if it works!** 🎉

If you see ANY new errors, share the console output and I'll help debug further!

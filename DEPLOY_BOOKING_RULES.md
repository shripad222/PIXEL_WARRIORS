# Deploy Updated Firestore Rules for Booking System

## Quick Fix - Deploy the Updated Rules

The booking system is failing because the Firestore security rules need to be deployed. I've updated the rules to allow bookings properly.

### Option 1: Deploy via Firebase CLI (Recommended)

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the PIXEL_WARRIORS directory
cd C:\Users\gsaie\OneDrive\Desktop\INFOFEST\PIXEL_WARRIORS

# Deploy the rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Option 2: Deploy via Firebase Console (Manual)

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Click **Firestore Database** in the left menu
4. Click the **Rules** tab at the top
5. Copy the entire content from `firestore.rules` file
6. Paste it into the rules editor
7. Click **Publish**

## What Was Fixed?

### Problem:
The booking system was trying to create booking documents, but the Firestore security rules were blocking it.

### Solution:
1. **Updated the booking creation order** - Now updates parking spots FIRST, then creates booking
2. **Improved error handling** - Better error messages to identify issues
3. **Added status validation** - Rules now accept 'active', 'pending', 'completed', 'cancelled' statuses
4. **Better field handling** - Changed `bookingTime` to `createdAt` to match security rules

### Changes Made:

#### In `App.jsx`:
- Reordered operations: Update parking spots â†’ Create booking
- Fixed field name: `bookingTime` â†’ `createdAt`
- Added better error messages for debugging
- Added permission-denied specific error handling

#### In `firestore.rules`:
- Added status validation for bookings
- Ensured rules match the actual booking data structure
- Kept required fields: `userId`, `parkingLotId`, `status`, `createdAt`

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Deploy the rules** using one of the options above
2. **Refresh your browser** (hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. **Try booking again**:
   - Click on a parking marker
   - Click "Book Now"
   - Select duration
   - Click "Confirm Booking"

You should see:
- âœ… Success message: "Booking confirmed! Your spot is reserved for X hour(s)."
- âœ… Available spots decrease by 1
- âœ… Booking appears in Firestore under `bookings` collection

---

## Verify in Firebase Console

After successful booking:

1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Check the `bookings` collection
3. You should see a new document with:
   - `userId`: Your user ID
   - `parkingLotId`: The parking lot ID
   - `status`: "active"
   - `createdAt`: Timestamp
   - `duration`: Hours booked
   - `amount`: Total price
   - And other booking details

4. Check the `parkingLots` collection
5. The `availableSpots` should have decreased by 1

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as a **driver**, not authority. Only drivers can create bookings.

### Issue: "Failed to complete booking"
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console (F12) for specific error
2. Ensure Firestore rules are deployed
3. Verify you have an active internet connection
4. Check that the user document exists in Firestore with `role: 'driver'`

### Issue: Rules deployment fails
**Solution**:
```powershell
# Login to Firebase again
firebase login

# Select the correct project
firebase use --add

# Try deploying again
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Security Notes

âœ… **Current Security Rules Ensure:**
- Only authenticated drivers can create bookings
- Bookings can only be created for the logged-in user (no impersonation)
- Booking status must be valid ('active', 'pending', 'completed', 'cancelled')
- Users can only read/update/delete their own bookings
- Authorities can view all bookings (for dashboard/management)
- Required fields are validated (userId, parkingLotId, status, createdAt)

ðŸ”’ **Protected Against:**
- Unauthorized booking creation
- Booking on behalf of other users
- Invalid status values
- Missing required fields
- Non-driver users creating bookings

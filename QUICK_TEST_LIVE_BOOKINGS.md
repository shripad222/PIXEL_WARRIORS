## ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Live Bookings (0)" but booking was created

**Check 1: Console Errors?**
- Look for red text in console
- If yes ‚Üí Check Firestore rules deployment

**Check 2: Correct User Logged In?**
- Driver: Should see bookings they created
- Authority: Should see bookings for their parking lots

**Check 3: Booking Status**
- Open Firebase Console
- Go to Firestore ‚Üí bookings
- Check status field = "active"

**Quick Fix:**
```powershell
# Re-deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Hard refresh browser
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### ‚ùå Authority dashboard shows 0 bookings

**Check 1: Does parking lot have managerId?**
- Open Firebase Console ‚Üí parkingLots
- Find the parking lot
- Check `managerId` field exists
- Should match authority's UID

**Check 2: Does booking have managerId?**
- Open Firebase Console ‚Üí bookings
- Find the booking
- Check `managerId` field exists
- Should match parking lot's managerId

**Quick Fix:**
If `managerId` missing from booking:
1. Create a new booking (new bookings will have it)
2. OR manually add `managerId` in Firestore Console

### ‚ùå Console shows no logs

**Check 1: Console Filter**

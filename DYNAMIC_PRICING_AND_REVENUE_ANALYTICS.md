# Dynamic Pricing & Revenue Analytics Implementation ✅

**Date:** Phase 21 - Completed  
**Status:** ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Project:** PARK_EASY by PIXEL_WARRIORS

---

## 📋 Overview

Successfully implemented dynamic pricing with 20% surge when parking availability drops to 30% or less, and activated real-time revenue analytics in the Authority Dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Pricing System** ✅

**Trigger Logic:**
- When `availableSpots / totalSpots ≤ 30%` → 20% price increase
- Automatically calculates surge pricing during booking

**Calculation Formula:**
```javascript
availabilityRate = (availableSpots / totalSpots) * 100
isSurgePricing = availabilityRate <= 30
surgeMultiplier = isSurgePricing ? 1.20 : 1.0
pricePerHour = basePrice × surgeMultiplier
totalAmount = duration × pricePerHour
```

**Implementation Locations:**
- **Booking Logic:** `src/App.jsx` Lines 908-937
- **Confirmation Dialog:** Lines 938-975 (Shows "🔥 High Demand Pricing Active (+20%)")
- **Booking Data Storage:** Lines 1045-1053

**Data Stored in Booking:**
```javascript
{
  amount: totalAmount,              // Final price paid
  pricePerHour: pricePerHour,       // Applied rate (base or surge)
  basePrice: basePrice,             // Original price (₹50/hour)
  isSurgePricing: boolean,          // true if surge was active
  surgeMultiplier: 1.0 or 1.20      // Multiplier used
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Audit trail for pricing decisions
- Revenue analytics (base vs surge revenue)
- Refund calculations
- Historical analysis

---

### 2. **UI Surge Pricing Indicators** ✅

**Booking Modal - Price Display (Lines 1927-1957):**
- Shows crossed-out base price when surge is active
- Displays surge price in red with "🔥 +20%" badge
- Example: `₹50/hour` → `₹50/hour ₹60/hour 🔥 +20%`

**Booking Total - Rate Breakdown (Lines 2095-2142):**
- Real-time calculation based on current availability
- Shows "🔥 High Demand" badge when surge active
- Updates total amount dynamically

**Visual Design:**
- Crossed-out base price: `textDecoration: 'line-through', color: '#999'`
- Surge price: `color: '#ff4444', fontWeight: 'bold'`
- Badge: `background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #ff4444, #ff6b6b)'`

---

### 3. **Revenue Analytics - Authority Dashboard** ✅

**Activated Features:**

#### **Today's Revenue** (Previously "coming soon")
```javascript
const calculateRevenue = (bookings, timeframe) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const filtered = bookings.filter(b => {
    if (b.status !== 'completed') return false;
    const bookingDate = b.exitTime?.toDate?.() || b.createdAt?.toDate?.();
    if (timeframe === 'today') {
      return bookingDate.toDateString() === now.toDateString();
    }
  });
  return filtered.reduce((sum, b) => sum + (b.amount || 0), 0);
};
```

**Displays:** ₹{amount.toLocaleString()} (real-time)

#### **Monthly Revenue** (Previously "coming soon")
- Same calculation logic, filters by current month
- Aggregates all completed bookings this month
- Updates live as bookings complete

**Implementation:** `src/pages/AuthorityDashboard.jsx` Lines 321-358

---

### 4. **Real-Time Occupancy Analytics** ✅

**Hourly Occupancy Trend:**
- Replaced sample data with real booking calculations
- Shows 8am-7pm hourly breakdown
- Counts active bookings per hour slot

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const getHourlyOccupancy = () => {
  const hours = Array.from({length: 12}, (_, i) => i + 8);
  return hours.map(hour => {
    const bookingsAtHour = activeBookings.filter(b => {
      const startTime = b.startTime?.toDate?.();
      const endTime = b.endTime?.toDate?.();
      // Check if booking overlaps with this hour
      return startTime < hourEnd && endTime > hourStart;
    });
    return { hour: '9am', occupied: bookingsAtHour.length };
  });
};
```

**Location:** `src/pages/AuthorityDashboard.jsx` Lines 359-382

---

### 5. **Peak Hour Analysis** ✅

**Feature:**
- Identifies hour with highest booking count
- Displays in chart title: "Peak: 5pm (80 bookings)"
- Real-time calculation from actual data

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const peakHour = occupancyData.reduce((max, curr) => 
  curr.occupied > max.occupied ? curr : max, 
  occupancyData[0]
);
```

**Display:** Lines 390-391 in Authority Dashboard

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

### Dynamic Pricing
- [ ] Create booking when availability > 30% → Regular price shown
- [ ] Create booking when availability ≤ 30% → 20% surge shown
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog shows "🔥 High Demand Pricing Active"
- [ ] Check booking document has `isSurgePricing: true`
- [ ] Verify surge badge appears in booking modal

### Revenue Analytics
- [ ] Complete a booking → Today's revenue increases
- [ ] Check monthly revenue accumulates correctly
- [ ] Verify revenue shows in Indian Rupee format (₹1,234)
- [ ] Test with multiple completed bookings

### Occupancy Analytics
- [ ] Create booking → Occupancy chart updates for that hour
- [ ] Verify peak hour identification is correct
- [ ] Check hourly breakdown matches active bookings

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with 0 bookings → Should show ₹0 revenue
- [ ] Test exactly at 30% threshold → Should trigger surge
- [ ] Test with 29% availability → Should show surge pricing
- [ ] Test with 31% availability → Should show regular pricing

  userId: "abc123",
  parkingLotId: "xyz789",
  status: "completed",
  duration: 3,
  
  // NEW: Pricing metadata
  amount: 180,              // Final amount paid
  basePrice: 50,            // Original price
  pricePerHour: 60,         // Applied rate
  isSurgePricing: true,     // Surge flag
